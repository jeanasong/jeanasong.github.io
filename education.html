                    Crypto is the new monetory system and people will have no other choice but to adapt to it.
                    Crypto is decentralize and it's better to invest in it than putting your funds in the bank.
                    In Crypto you become your own bank and no one controls your wealth except you.
                    Bitcoin is the first Crypto to be launch in the world in 2008 by an anonymous person name "Satoshi Nakamoto".
                    If you studied the monetory system you will know the former president of moroco was trying to do the same thing
                    by making the national currency to be back-up by Gold and Silver and this will make all the big nations in the world go bankrupt.
                    The U.S.A United Nations (UN) and European power nations joined forces and killed him because he was going to make every nation free
                    and the will become independent. If he would had done it all the nations that you think are rich are third world nations 
                    like U.S.A, France, England, Germany and ect because all this nations have no natural resouces to back-up their currency.
                    Bitcoin is the digital version of Gold and Silver. Just like Gold and Silver no government or anyone can controll it. You have full controll in your hands.

                    The true form of money is Gold and Silver that's God's money mankind can't manipulate it. Gold and Silver was here before mankind was created.
                    Gold and Silver are commodity back-up by natural resources from the earth and has never lose it value. Everything else is cuurency and all national currency has all gone to zero.
                    Nothing on earth has ever defeated Gold and Silver not even the romans empire. All national currencies like USD, EUR, POUND will go to zero because they're not back by any natural resouces.
                    If you look throughout history when nations go on economic crisis how do they recover? Simple answer by going back to the Gold and Silver standard.
                    All national currencies are created to die and return to thier infinite value of zero. That's how you can become the richest person in the world in currencies that has no value to controll people
                    just like how government and banks does, and what do all rich people have in common? Hm Broke as mash patato when the economic falls.
                    It's better to be wealthy than be rich and the only way is through Gold and Silver. Now we have an alternative way that crypto like Bitcoin which is part of wealth for the people because of it use cases.
                    A rich man will always be destroy, you can never destroy wealth because it's always pass on to the next generation.
                    That's why it's greater to be wealthy than to be rich. You can be rich in manipulation of mankind which is national currency or be wealthy in natural resouces from the earth made for the people which is Gold, Silver and Bitoin.
                    You can't be rich and wealthy at the same moment because when you die one of them will have no value to you or the next generation. 
                    That's like me giving you the first ever national currency to be created on earth to use in today's world what value does it have? I'll wait! Zero. The value of any today's currency
