                I have been investing in Crypto for five years now and I do some shot term Swing trading on the side.
                Crypto is my main source of investment and every funds I have I invest it in Crypto. 
                Currently I have invested in over 100 crypto including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Chainlink, Uniswap, Polkadot,
                Dogecoin, Litecoin, SHiba Inu, Compound, AMP, Ethereum Claasic, Bitcoin Cash and ect. 
                My strategy is to accumulate as much crypto as I can and deverse my Portofolio. I use Crypto exchanges
                like Binan.us, Kraken and Coinbase to buy the crypto and send it to my cold wallet Ledger Nano S plus to store it offline.
                Am not planning to sell in the next 15 years. When the price drop I buy more to increase my position size.
                Why I use this strategy is because if I would've invested in Bitcoin in 2012 at then Bitcoin was at $14.
                Say I would've invested $500 then by now I my portfolio will be worth 1.8 Billion, and continue buying the deep.

                I have been investing in commodity since I was a child in Cameroon, West Africa. We use Gold and Silver more than any other transactions.
                Since I moved to the USA I use an exchange "GoldSilver" to buy my commodity and send them back home or store them on a safe.
                If you're new to investing in Commodity and Monetory System I recommend to start watching Mike Maloney YouTube Channel.
